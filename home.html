          Back in the year 2011, before the days of Uber and Instagram, there was a lonely computer nerd playing dungeons and dragons with his friends. Living an hour away in a pantry in Lebanon, NH was a Southern belle waiting to crack an inappropriate joke. Enter OkCupid, a boring profile, a rabid Trex, and love at first sight. The rest is history. The Vickening shall take place 9/2/2017. In the meantime feel free to travel through the website. We are beyond excited to celebrate our weird in the mountains of New Hampshire with everyone we love! Donâ€™t forget to RSVP!
