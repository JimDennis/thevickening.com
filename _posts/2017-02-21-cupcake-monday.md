Cake is amazing. Cupcakes are even better. 

Aside from being tiny morsels of heaven, cupcakes are easy for the guests to eat and they open up the possibility for variety! My dentist bill can tell you that I love chocolate. Chris, being the robot that he is, doesn’t care for rich sweets. Choosing to go with cupcakes allows us to both have what we want! And I don’t have to leave Chris for fulfilling his promise of shoving cake in my face. Win-win. With this is mind, the decision of what to serve for dessert at the wedding was easy. How we want to display it was a whole other question.

 A rainy day off, a penchant for baking, and a lot of cream cheese icing gave us our answer. 

Chris & I were so dedicated to wedding planning, we walked to the corner store for cupcake supplies immediately to test our latest display idea. After forgetting most of what we came for and a shamefaced second trip, we were ready to experiment! Listening to records and making carrot cake cupcakes (guess who chose THAT flavor) reminded me of what this whole thing is really all about! 

It’s easy to get lost in the hectic whirlwind of planning,but it’s always going to be the small and unplanned moments that you remember the most. Icing 24 cupcakes while watching the Sopranos, stacking cupcakes along a dusty apartment bookcase to test an idea, almost accidentally smashing a cupcake with a book and laughing until your sides hurt...
Cupcake Monday will forever live on in my memory as one of my favorite wedding planning memories, even if it’s a small one in the scheme of things. Just don’t ask me how my wedding diet is going...
