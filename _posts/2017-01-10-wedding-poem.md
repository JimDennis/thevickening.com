  Roses are red...

Planning a wedding is lots of fun  
But it’s also not a job for one

My groom likes to say “I don’t know”  
When I ask questions like “red, pink or yellow”

The food definitely must taste good  
The decor better not be tacky…as it if it could!

The dress is lovely, lace and white  
The flowers will cause gasps of delight

Champagne chugging is part of the plan  
And a toke or two…yeah maaaaan 

I cannot wait to hit the dance floor  
Let’s dance away the stress of this wedding making us poor

Being surrounded by people we love the most  
Makes it so so worth it to be the host!
