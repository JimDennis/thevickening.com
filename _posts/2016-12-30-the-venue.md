  One of the biggest questions when planning #thevickening was where should it take place? Do we want to get married in a backyard? In front of the mountains? By the beach? Do we want to get married in Texas, California, or New Hampshire? We finally narrowed it down to where we met... New Hampshire.

One of the biggest questions when planning #thevickening was where should it take place? Do we want to get married in a backyard? In front of the mountains? By the beach? Do we want to get married in Texas, California, or New Hampshire? We finally narrowed it down to where we met... New Hampshire.

Chris & I were very inspired by our friend Shannon & Jacob’s wedding. It was beautiful, casual, and we all stayed the night to extend the party. If there’s anything I want, it’s to extend the best party I ever plan on throwing! 

We knew that we wanted to get married in NH but had no idea where. Kim, Chris’ Mom, toured a place called Cobb Hill Estate and I digitally fell in love! It was risky to book a venue without having seen it in person but I’ve always had a bit of a gambling problem. 

We finally got to tour the place ourselves in December and it was magical! Everywhere I looked I could see myself smiling & chugging champagne (I like to maintain realistic fantasies). Hitting the jackpot in venues was a little bit research and a little bit luck.

And just remember that if you don’t get your first choice, there’s always another beautiful place to chug champagne in!
